## 3. Colour System (MANDATORY)

The mity john ecosystem supports **two tightly controlled colour modes**:
1. **Yellow / Black** (core brand)
2. **Dark Green / Orange** (Music Agent & AI tooling)

Copilot must stay strictly within these palettes.

### 3.3 Palette Selection Rules

Copilot must choose **ONE dominant mode per artifact**:

#### Yellow / Black Mode
Use when:
- Branding mity john
- Personal site content
- Blog posts
- Talks, slides, keynotes
- Creative identity material

#### Dark Green / Orange Mode
Use when:
- Referring to Music Agent
- AI orchestration
- Agent-based systems
- Technical demos
- Tools, consoles, dashboards

Do **NOT** mix both modes in the same screen unless explicitly instructed.

### 3.4 Colour Usage Rules (Strict)

- High contrast is **required**
- Orange and yellow are **never used for long text**
- Accent colours are used for:
  - CTAs
  - Key words
  - Active elements
  - Directional indicators (arrows, flow)
- Backgrounds are always:
  - Black / Dark Green
- Text is always:
  - White on dark
  - Black on yellow / orange

---

### 3.5 Forbidden Colour Usage

Copilot must **never** introduce:
- Pastels
- Gradients
- Corporate blue
- Purple / pink
- Random accent colours
- Material UI default palettes

If a colour is not defined above, it does not exist.

---

### 3.6 Visual Intent

- Yellow / Black = **Identity & Energy**
- Dark Green / Orange = **Control, Depth, Orchestration**

If it looks “friendly SaaS” → wrong  
If it looks “corporate enterprise” → wrong  
If it looks “bold tool built by musicians & engineers” → correct
